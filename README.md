# Spork

_"Half spoon, half Zork"_

Spork is a small interpreter for a text adventure language. It's basically a slightly updated design of a language I first created when I was 19. I've had a number of attempts at it over the years first in C with Lex & Yacc, next in Go with Goyacc, this time I'm using Tree-sitter and javascript as I'd quite like a web version for people to try.

The language is more programmery than the new wave of prose-based langauges and is heavily object-oriented (well, object, location, item-oriented), though I'd like to pretend it's entity-oriented.

The working subset of the language currently looks like this, though the final language is far richerâ€¦
